### Forest health indicators for SIMO


- **Shelter**:   even/uneven aged forest: even-aged= if 80% of the volume is located in age classes 20 years apart
- **Serenity**:  if distant > 400m from road at 70km/h
- **Diversity**: Volume for individual species & count; Volume share by species? If > 70%, then not a diverse forest
- **Nature**:    mean age > 100 years; Age_vol, Age_ba (lower than Age_vol)
- **Cohesion**:  stand area > 1 ha

### How to combine dimensions? 

- **Edges/glades**:    shelter, nature, diversity
- **Deep forest**:     nature, shelter, serenity
- **Spacious forest**: cohesion, serenity, nature


### Forest management regimes:

Select the most diverse management regimes: 

- **BAU** - business as usual: final cut, including thinnings
- **CCF** - continuous cover forestry, no final cut
- **SA**  - set aside, no harvest

Variation in regimes:

- in rotation length
- in final harvest type (yes, no, green tree retention)
- variation in thinnings: no thinnings

# Calculate the volume proportion by species, V = total volume

# Get proportion of volume per species from total volume: `V`
# select all columns containing species and divide it bu total volume
# reclassify based on rule: diverse if <70% of volume is made by one species
df.prop = select(df, c(V_pine, V_spruce, V_Birch_1, V_Birch_2, V_populus, V_Alnus_incana, V_Alnus_glutinosa, V_o_coniferous, V_o_decidious))/df$V*100

### Distribution of stands by selected variables:

Distributions of selected variables depends on selection of study site!! E.g. depends on the N-S gradient.

This example: from Korsnas, Finland, 300 stands



![Fig. 1: Map of Korsnas stands, and position within Finland](C:/MyTemp/myGitLab/bayesianESS/build_ess_models_bayesian/Health/Korsnas_map.PNG)

### Dimensions

#### Shelter:

- stands with height < 5 m and density (N) > 5000 trees/ha:

**Very few stands, need to adjust the density?**

```{r N-density, echo=FALSE, fig.dim = c(3, 3), include=FALSE}

# Filter data

df <- df %>% 
  filter(H_dom < 100) %>% 
  filter(regime %in% c("BAU", "CCF_2", "SA_DWextract"))
  
df %>% 
  #filter(H_dom < 5) %>% 
  filter(N > 5000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(N,
             fill = regime)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

What is the relationship between stand density and tree height?

```{r scatter-density, echo = FALSE, fig.dim = c(7, 2.5), message=FALSE}

df <- df %>% 
  filter(H_dom < 100) %>% 
  filter(regime %in% c("BAU", "CCF_2", "SA_DWextract"))
  
#df %>% 
  #filter(H_dom < 5) %>% 
#  filter(N > 5000) %>% 
#  summarize(min = min(H_dom, na.rm = T),
  #          max = max(H_dom, na.rm = T)) 


df %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = N,
            y = H_dom,
            color = regime)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5, 
             col = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5000, 
             col = "red") + 
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("Tree height (m)") +
  xlab("N trees/ha") +
  facet_grid(.~regime) +
  theme(legend.position = 'right')



```

#### Serenity: 

- disance from major roads
- Daniel show road network over the forest stand geometry?

#### Diversity:  

- deadwood, tree species  on stand level
- discuss and complete today

#### Nature: 

- age > 100 years old (100-140)

Mean age of all stands is  `r round(mean(df$Age), 1)` years old. Distribution by regimes: 

```{r hist-age, echo=FALSE, fig.dim = c(7, 2.5), message=FALSE}

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age,
             fill = regime)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 100) + 
  facet_grid(.~regime) +
     theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  theme_classic()
 

```

#### Cohesion:

- stands over 20 ha 

20 ha to m2 = 200.000 m2, e.g. 450*450 m
- too large stands?? Mean stand area is `r round(mean(df$AREA, na.rm = T), 1)` ha. 

```{r hist-AREA, echo=FALSE, fig.dim = c(3, 2.5), message=FALSE}

df %>% 
  filter(year == 2016 & regime == "BAU") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = AREA,
             fill = regime)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  #geom_vline(xintercept = 20) + 
  theme_classic() +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  xlab("area (ha)") 
 
```
